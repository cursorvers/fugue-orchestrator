# GHA24 Mainframe Flow

## Purpose
Capture how a GHA24 request gets into the existing FUGUE mainframe path (tutti vote → optional Codex implementation) so readers can quickly understand the automation, guardrails, and monitoring around that "mainframe" stage of the pipeline.

## High-level flow
1. **Enter the mainframe path (two options).**
   - **CLI (two-step):** `scripts/gha24` creates the `fugue-task` issue with a minimal spec skeleton, then immediately edits the same issue to add the `tutti` label. Optional `--orchestrator codex|claude` (`GHA24_ORCHESTRATOR_PROVIDER`) and `--assist-orchestrator claude|codex|none` (`GHA24_ASSIST_ORCHESTRATOR_PROVIDER`) add per-issue routing metadata. CLI default mode remains implement unless review-only intent is explicit (or `--review` is passed). Implement mode adds `implement-confirmed` automatically.
   - **Mobile / natural language:** Create a plain `fugue-task` issue (no `## GHA24 Task` header). `fugue-task-router` treats this as auto-mainframe by default: it adds `tutti`, normalizes orchestrator labels (`orchestrator:*`, `orchestrator-assist:*`), and dispatches the mainframe workflow directly. Use explicit manual markers (`#manual`, `#no-gha24`, `manual only`) to opt out. Natural-language default mode is now review-first; implement requires explicit intent.
2. **Tutti consensus.** Adding label `tutti` fires `.github/workflows/fugue-tutti-caller.yml`, which resolves main/assist orchestrators with this precedence: issue labels → body hints → repo defaults (`FUGUE_MAIN_ORCHESTRATOR_PROVIDER`, `FUGUE_ASSIST_ORCHESTRATOR_PROVIDER`, legacy fallback `FUGUE_ORCHESTRATOR_PROVIDER`). By default, `FUGUE_CLAUDE_ROLE_POLICY=sub-only` demotes main `claude` to `codex` unless forced. Assist defaults to `none`, then is auto-escalated to Claude only when triggers fire (high risk, correction signal, or high ambiguity score), controlled by `FUGUE_CLAUDE_SUB_AUTO_ESCALATE` and `FUGUE_CLAUDE_SUB_AMBIGUITY_MIN_SCORE`. For assist `claude`, `FUGUE_CLAUDE_RATE_LIMIT_STATE=degraded` applies `FUGUE_CLAUDE_DEGRADED_ASSIST_POLICY` (default `none`), and `exhausted` always falls back to `none` unless forced. Additionally, when `main=claude` and `assist=claude`, pressure guard applies (`FUGUE_CLAUDE_MAIN_ASSIST_POLICY=codex|none`, default `codex`) unless forced. Then `.github/workflows/fugue-tutti-router.yml` runs a **6-lane baseline vote** (Codex3 + GLM3), adds one **main-provider signal lane** (`codex-main-orchestrator` or `claude-main-orchestrator`), and adds optional specialist lanes (Claude Opus/Sonnet assist, Gemini, xAI) as needed. Lane execution uses `FUGUE_CI_EXECUTION_ENGINE` (`harness` default, `api` fallback), lane depth is controlled by `FUGUE_MULTI_AGENT_MODE` (`standard|enhanced|max`, default `enhanced`), and execution approval is decided by **role-weighted 2/3 consensus + HIGH-risk veto**.
3. **Codex implementation (optional).** When the issue carries implementation intent and confirmation labels (`implement` + `implement-confirmed`, plus compatibility labels when present), the passed vote hands off to `fugue-codex-implement`, which checks whether the target repo is the current repo or a cross-repo target before installing `@openai/codex`, running Codex CLI, and creating a PR. Implement mode is gated by refinement loops (Plan → Parallel Simulation → Critical Review → Problem Fix → Replan) repeated `FUGUE_IMPLEMENT_REFINEMENT_CYCLES` times (default 3), then role-dialogue implementation loops (`Implementer/ Critic/ Integrator`) with rounds controlled by `FUGUE_IMPLEMENT_DIALOGUE_ROUNDS` (default 2) and `FUGUE_IMPLEMENT_DIALOGUE_ROUNDS_CLAUDE` (default 1 when main=claude). It also enforces shared playbook artifacts (`.fugue/pre-implement/issue-<N>-todo.md`, `.fugue/pre-implement/lessons.md`) before PR creation is accepted.

## Guardrails
- **Spec skeleton.** Every issue created via `scripts/gha24` follows the template under `## GHA24 Task` / `## Spec (minimal)`, so every request documents `Goal`, `Must not` constraints, concrete acceptance criteria, and rollback instructions. The structured checklist keeps machine readers and judges consistent inputs across requests.
- **Router skip.** `fugue-task-router` short-circuits whenever an issue already carries `tutti` or `processing`, and it also skips issues using the `## GHA24 Task` header (those are expected to be driven by `scripts/gha24`). This keeps the "plain fugue-task router" lane and the "GHA24 mainframe" lane from competing. A similar guard prevents `fugue-tutti-router` from reprocessing the same issue while `processing` is attached.
- **PAT guard.** If a Codex implementation needs to target a repo other than the orchestrator, `fugue-codex-implement` refuses to run unless the optional `TARGET_REPO_PAT` secret is provided. Missing PATs result in a comment, a `needs-human` label, and no further automation, ensuring we never push cross-repo changes without explicit secrets consent.
- **Review-only guard.** If an issue requests review-only (`## Mode` = `review` or natural-language review-only intent), stale implementation labels are cleared or ignored before the mainframe handoff, so Codex implementation will not run accidentally.
- **Implement confirmation guard.** Even when implementation intent is present, Codex execution is blocked until `implement-confirmed` exists. This prevents accidental autonomous changes from ambiguous mobile/natural-language requests.
- **Refinement guard.** Implement workflow validates a preflight report with the 5-step loop for each configured cycle; missing sections fail the run before PR creation.
- **Implementation collaboration guard.** Implement workflow validates an implementation dialogue report (`Implementer Proposal`, `Critic Challenge`, `Integrator Decision`, `Applied Change`, `Verification`) for each configured round; missing sections fail the run before PR creation.
- **Task/Lessons guard.** Implement workflow validates `.fugue/pre-implement/issue-<N>-todo.md` (Plan/Checklist/Progress/Review + checkbox items) and requires `.fugue/pre-implement/lessons.md` to exist as the shared self-improvement ledger.
- **Risk-tier guard.** Implement workflow resolves `risk-tier (low|medium|high)` from issue text/labels to keep low-risk tasks lightweight while forcing deeper loops and review fan-out for high-risk tasks.
- **Conditional lessons guard.** Lessons updates become strict when correction/postmortem signals are present (`user-corrected`, `postmortem`, `regression`, `incident` or equivalent text cues).
- **Large-refactor guard.** `scripts/gha24` auto-adds `large-refactor` when task text indicates refactor/rewrite/migration, and implement workflow enforces `Candidate A/B + Failure Modes + Rollback Check` on every cycle.
- **Watchdog.** `.github/workflows/fugue-watchdog.yml` runs hourly to keep the mainframe healthy: it checks OpenAI/Z.ai connectivity, verifies that both `fugue-task-router` and `fugue-tutti-caller` have had a successful run in the last 3 hours, posts a Discord alert if anything is stale, and works through open `fugue-task` issues that lack `processing`/`completed` labels by retriggering the router.
- **Fast profile switch.** Switching `FUGUE_MAIN_ORCHESTRATOR_PROVIDER` / `FUGUE_ASSIST_ORCHESTRATOR_PROVIDER` immediately changes routing without code rollback.
- **Claude throttle guard.** `FUGUE_CLAUDE_RATE_LIMIT_STATE={ok|degraded|exhausted}` provides an operations kill-switch. With `FUGUE_CLAUDE_ROLE_POLICY=sub-only` (default), main `claude` is demoted to `codex` unless forced. Assist `claude` degrades via `FUGUE_CLAUDE_DEGRADED_ASSIST_POLICY={none|codex}` on `degraded` and is forced to `none` on `exhausted` unless per-issue forced.
- **Claude pressure guard.** `FUGUE_CLAUDE_MAIN_ASSIST_POLICY={codex|none}` avoids `main=claude` + `assist=claude` duplication by auto-adjusting assist unless forced, reducing fast rate-limit exhaustion.

## Mobile quick start
- Create a GitHub Issue using the template **FUGUE Task (Mobile / Natural Language)** (auto-adds label `fugue-task`), or manually add label `fugue-task`.
- Use structured fields when possible:
  - `Mainframe handoff`: `auto` or `manual`
  - `Execution mode`: `review` (default) or `implement`
  - `Implementation confirmation`: `pending` or `confirmed` (required for implementation execution)
  - Optional provider/mode fields (`Main orchestrator provider`, `Assist orchestrator provider`, `Multi-agent mode`)
- Natural-language fallback markers are still supported:
  - `レビューのみ` (review-only)
  - `#manual` / `#no-gha24` / `manual only` (skip auto-mainframe handoff)
  - target repo in backticks, e.g. `cursorvers/cloudflare-workers-hub` (FUGUE adds `proj:<repo>` label + title prefix)

## Observability
- Tutti summaries, vote tallies, and Codex CLI output live directly on the originating GitHub issue so reviewers can trace decisions.
- `fugue-watchdog` issues Discord alerts with the last-success timestamps and hours-since metrics whenever the router/mainframe runners stall, which keeps the codex team aware of automation outages.
- The `processing` label heartbeat and `needs-human` escalations form a feedback loop: humans can step in when trust, PATs, or agency votes raise concerns.
